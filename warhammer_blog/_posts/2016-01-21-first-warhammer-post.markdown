Welcome to my warhammer blog!

This will mostly be used for posting progress updates and for showing off my painting stuff, also hobby projects such as scenery etc. This is mostly intended to keep me motivated with my painting and for getting into the habbit of blogging about stuff. For exmaple, I might write the odd piece about interesting rumours and what not!

Anyway, if anyone does find this and look at the stuff, I hope you enjoy! Please feel free to leave any feedback or comments, dropping me an email etc about C&C, it's always appreciated.
