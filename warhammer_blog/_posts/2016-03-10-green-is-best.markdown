Here's some of the boyz and a boss that I've been working on lately. I've tried some new techniques on the skin with thinner layering and different shades of green to get some nice effects. I'm pretty fond of the heads that the warboss has, they turned out quite nice. Copious amounts of blood for the blood god is always good fun.

Around the time I finished these I played a game with the misses. Skaven vs Orcs & Gobbos. It was pretty good fun! I convinced her to try out tooling up a skaven warlord for once, however, I also took a black orc and sat him in the watchtower (we rolled a 6) in the mission. They kind of stayed in there all game, lost one orc and just absolutely butchered her poor stormvermin every time they attempted to boot them out.

Anyway, all's fun and games til you meet an angry black orc big boss in a tower.
