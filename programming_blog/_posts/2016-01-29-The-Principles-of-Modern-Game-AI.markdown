The Principles of Modern Game AI (or IA!)

As I mentioned in the previous post, I've recently enrolled in a new course offered by aigamedev.net with the above title. This course is actually one of the most interesting and exciting online courses that I've been a part of. The material is broad and very interesting, however, this is also it's greatest weakness. While it's great that the course touches on many subjects and introduces them succinctly but albeit briefly, there is a lacking of depth. That being said I'm sure that it was actually the intention of the designers to whet the appetite of the students into studying areas of interest more themselves, if this was the case it has worked very well on me. I particularly love the videos covering the architecture and design of the systems used in the examples. I find DoD and other data oriented ways of thinking to be very interesting and I really enjoy learning more about how they work in the real world, for example, there's a good talk by Vittorio Romeo from 2015's CPPCon titled [Implementation of a component-based entity system in modern C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTWSeQtHZ9M) which I highly recommend to anyone interested. 

One of my goals is to take the programming assignments and re-create them using UE4, the idea being to use these small prototypes as cool examples / reasons to learn EU4 so I can make something cool with it in the future, plus, it'd be fun to do! I'll make some posts about each assignment when I get the hang of using UE4 properly. (I might try to re-create these myself with something in 2D/3D for fun, but finding time with my other hobbies - violin, warhammer etc is quite difficult) 

I am very much looking forward to the forthcoming assignment titled Mapping SUPER MARIO, which I can only surmise involves mapping Mario's world and directing him through it. This is really something that I love the concept of, I've been very interested in AI for a long time and one of the first things I read that really interested me in it was the [Mario AI Challenge](http://www.marioai.org/). Along the same lines, the [student starcraft AI tournament happened](http://sscaitournament.com/) recently, again this is something that I'd love to be a part of! I briefly had a look through their APIs and they seem quite interesting to use. I think I might start creating one of these bots but I am no sure how involved I can be given that I am no longer a student.

Finally, I'm building up the site day by day and I have to admit that it's quite fun to do this from scratch, I feel pretty clueless with most of the things I am trying to do, but that makes all the more fun when I get something working.
