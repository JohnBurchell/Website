First post on the new platform!

So, the subscription was ending in a few weeks on my current CMS//webspace and I decided to switch over to something a little more involved.

I'll do some more posts in a while, but this means I have to pretty much start from scratch with everything else that I had on here, potfolio etc, which is good news! I also plan on creating another blog for all my warhammer stuff, so stay posted for updates and interesting things (not that anyone is reading this - especially the first post!)

a test highlight!
