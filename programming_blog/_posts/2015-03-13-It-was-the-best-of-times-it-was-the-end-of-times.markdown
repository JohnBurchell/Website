----------------- 

The title, in a sense, is as apocalyptic as it sounds.

Ok so, last weekend the final book in the end times series was released. I binge read the entire thing on the day of release, it was thrilling and quite saddening at the same time. Lets just say, the title was fitting and Iâ€™m very excited to see where the series will go. A little worried too as to see something youâ€™ve grown up with (Iâ€™ve been playing since I was uh..12?) that you love, change this much, makes one kind of anxious.

With that out of the way, things have been quite busy lately. Iâ€™ve been studying quite a bit for various things. I recently finished Algorithms 1 from Stanford University Via coursera. Probably one of the best MOOCs Iâ€™ve done, if Iâ€™m honest. Iâ€™m currently slogging my way through Coding The Matrix: Linear Algebra, but itâ€™s very rewarding and Iâ€™m already thinking how what Iâ€™m learning there can apply elsewhere. Itâ€™s shed a new light on the Graphics course which I took last year, the proofs etc are making more sense and I feel like re-taking it.

Anyway, the end times are also approaching for me, in terms of Uni. Thereâ€™s only a few months left and weâ€™re coming to the end to the last two courses at GU, excluding the Thesis. Talking of the Thesis, weâ€™re starting that up now, so itâ€™s lots of reading and writing about papers. On the subject of courses, Iâ€™ve been enrolled in a Game Design distance course at LuleÃ¥ University. The course is pretty interesting, the lecturers bring up some good stuff and the literature given is very insightful. I look forward to the rest of the lectures in the coming weeks.

Game wise, not much is happening really. Attila: Total War came out back in Feb and Iâ€™ve been playing that, when I get the chance to play games. I have to admit, the changes they have made to the formula are pretty awesome. I was playing my first campaign as the Geats (Vikings, hailing from GÃ¶taland, so I had to!) and itâ€™s really good! The difficulty has actually ramped up quite a bit. In the previous titles, Very Hard was a challenge, but it wasnâ€™t so bad. In Attila? It had me crying like a little girl. On the note of the man himself, the way they introduce his story is really well done, so hopefully, if what the rumor mill suggests CA is cooking up next is true, weâ€™ll see some interesting things ðŸ˜‰
