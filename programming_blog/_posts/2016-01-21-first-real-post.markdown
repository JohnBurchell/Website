Ok, so everything seems to be going well! 

As mentioned in the other post, my subscription to my current CMS/managed web space was up for renewal and I decided to take the plunge and run with my own stuff (hosted on Linode at the suggest of friends).

So far things have been quite interesting and entertaining, I was fairly ignorant about how the whole DNS and web hosting worked, I wouldn't say that I'm knowledgeable now, but I'm not fumbling around in the dark any-more.

Anyway, some more detailed posts will probably come up this weekend. I'll also add back some previous posts from my old wordpress blog, the next post will be a proper one with updates and some cool stuff that I've been doing as part of an AI (or should I say, IA?) course.
