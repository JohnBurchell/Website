I’ve been rather busy with school lately, but it’s actually been rather fun, despite the annoyances.

This term we had a course about Model Driven Software Development. I’d heard of it before but had never actually “done it” so to say. It was very interesting to see the differing points of view of all kinds of people when it comes to the given problem domain of a specific kind of system. In this case it happened to be a hotel management system.

Long story short, this was the first time that I’ve actually implemented a majority of what I’ve so far learnt at school into something practical. By this I mean all the software engineering theories, design, UML and anything in between. I have to say that it’s opened my eyes a little bit to how difficult this can be. On the other hand I did really enjoy the implementation phase, working closely with some good colleagues made the whole process easier, I’m really starting to like working in a team the more I do it. It was good fun to use pair programming a little bit, it’s always interesting to see what others come up with and to have to explain (at least I did, whether they wanted to know or not!) my thought process to others.

Anyway, new term, new year. Things should be a little less hectic (famous last words) this term. I found a cool story idea for the platformer which has re-invigorated me to get at least a single level with enemies, some art, parallax scrolling and some other nifty features working.

My other hobbies are going well too! The violin is getting harder, but at the same time they’re easier to pick up and grasp. Vibrato still eludes me but I think I’ll have it down in a few months. The warhammer is also going well, I’ve got the painting bug again and I’ve been working on some Sisters of Slaughter, exciting times!
